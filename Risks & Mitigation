Risks & Mitigation 
Limited prior experience to cyber security so we may struggle greatly.
Research and ask for help.
Professor Borchadt may not help as much as we hope. 
Reach out to Professor Obyermyer for other resources and help. 
We might be taking on too big of scope and may not finish all that we hope to. 
Limit it and cut the scope down as soon as we feel overwhelmed. 
Available resources may be limited and we may not be able to accomplish what we want to. 
Brainstorm a different way to use other resources to accomplish our goals. 

- Look out for Open ports, outdated software with known vulnerabilities, default passwords on devices.
